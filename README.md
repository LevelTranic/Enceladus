# Enceladus

> **The software is made as a Rust version of [Mars](https://github.com/LevelTranic/Mars) and is currently under development.**


## Differences between Enceladus and Mars, and other api
### Mars
- Developed in Golang
- Closed source (source code available on request)
- Consistent with PaperAPI, allowing for seamless migration
- Fastest update speed
- More mature
- Excellent performance and resource utilization
- Lightweight implementation, no need for bulky JVM
- Support hardware acceleration
- Supports mysql and sqlite and can be used without setting up
- redis support is on the way
- Web management portal is on the way

### Enceladus
- Developed in Rust
- Closed source (source code available on request)
- Consistent with PaperAPI, allowing for seamless migration
- Best performance and resource utilization
- Relatively less mature (started later than Mars and is more difficult to develop)
- Lightweight implementation, no need for bulky JVM
- Support hardware acceleration
- Support mysql, sqlite, pgsql
- redis support is on the way
- Web management portal is on the way

### PaperAPI
- Developed in Java
- Open Source
- High resource usage (possibly)
- most complete
- Use mongodb. Requires additional setup

### Other API
- Developed in Java / Kotlin
- Open Source / Closed source
- API is not standardized
- High resource usage
- Use mongodb or mysql. Requires additional setup
